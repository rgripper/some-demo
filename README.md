# SomeDemo

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via Karma.

I've added tests for `owner-gender.component.spec`

## TODO

Ideallly I would add ngrx store with state and wire up `cats-by-owner-gender.component` with `Store<AppState>`.
